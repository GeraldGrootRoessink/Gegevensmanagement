    documentation="Service Organization Controls (SOC)&#xD;&#xA;SOC 2 Engagements   Assess the organization's controls that affect the security (confidentiality, integrity, and availability) and privacy of information stored in a system. SOC 2 audit results are confidential and are normally only shared outside the organization under an NDA.&#xD;&#xA;SOC 3 Engagements   Assess the organization's controls that affect the security (confidentiality, integrity, and availability) and privacy of information stored in a system. However, SOC 3 audit results are intended for public disclosure.&#xD;&#xA;In addition to the three categories of SOC assessment, there are two different types of SOC report. Both reports begin with providing a description by management of the controls put in place. They differ in the scope of the opinion provided by the auditor:&#xD;&#xA;Type I Reports   These reports provide the auditor's opinion on the description provided by management and the suitability of the design of the controls. Type I reports also cover only a specific point in time, rather than an extended period. You can think of the Type I report as more of a documentation review where the auditor is checking things out on paper and making sure that the controls described by management are reasonable and appropriate.&#xD;&#xA;Type II Reports   These reports go further and also provide the auditor's opinion on the operating effectiveness of the controls. That is, the auditor actually confirms that the controls are functioning properly. The Type II report also covers an extended period of time: at least six months of operation. "/>
